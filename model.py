"""
	This program reads in an isochrone produced from http://stev.oapd.inaf.it/cgi-bin/cmd, along with the mass of the star to be considered.
		From this, it draws the other necessary parameters for the star (luminousity and temperature) from the isochrone and calculates the expected mode frequencies and amplitudes using equations
        from Huber et.al (2011), Kjeldsen & Bedding (1995) and Lecture Notes on Stellar Oscillations by J. Christensen-Dalsgaard [5th Ed. 2003/03]. The number of frequencies calculated can be specified by the user.
	The program then sums the sines of these frequencies along with some noise to produced the ideal signal. From this we can then use the program to test various scenarios with different sampling rates and observation length and see the results.
	The programs used the Lomb-Scargle method to analyse the sampled signal.Many modifications can be made in order to organise your output and how the program runs.
		The purpose of this program is to be able to run simlutions on measuring mode frequenceis of different stars to find suitable targets for the HERMES spectrographs to search for exoplanets around.
